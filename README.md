## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Favorite Apps

### App Idea

**App Name:** *HowWasYourDay* 

A daily mood tracker that lets users select a color that reflects their current emotional state, pick an emoji to describe their mood, or write down any notes. Over time, the application visualizes trends in moods and color and reports back to the user. Possible features include mood logs, color-based calendar, and daily notifications.  



## Notes

One challenge I faced when implementing this application was ensuring that the changeColor function was properly nested in the changeBackgroundColor function.
